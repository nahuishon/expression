       Okay you guys I'm gonna sing
        You this song right now
         This is a kind of a sweet song
    I sing it to my wife
    Because she let's me talk about so many things
    In front of you people
    And she doesn't even get mad at me
    She's pretty damn cool
    So here we go...
    I met you 20 years ago
    And we talked all night
    You drank me under the table
    Yeah, it was love at first sight
    I knew right then and there
    I'd grow old with you
    I said I'd tell you jokes whenever you are sad
    Make you a mom, if you made me a dad
    Oh, it's been so much fun
    Growing old with you
     </p>
     <p class="grow">
    Oh, oh
    I love you
    Foot rub you
    Tell you you're the only one I'm thinking of
    Make big decisions with you
    Try new positions with you
    Even sit and watch
    Fucking Eat Pray Love
    Two times in a row
    Now when I'm on a diet
    You take away my potatoes
    Say "Fuck all those guys"
    After reading Rotten Tomatoes
    I hope they all die miserable deaths
    As I grow old with you
    You scold me
    You hold me
    Look the other way
    When I dress like a pimp
    You cry to me
    You lie to me
    But only when you tell me
    That the dick looks big
    Now, we don't need a big house
    We don't need any money
    All we need is you and me
    And Sadie and Sunny
    I got everything I want
    Growing old with you</P>
